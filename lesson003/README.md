# Comments on some problems

---

## Comparisons

1. undefined is equal to null only when we have '==' .
2. '===' converts datatypes so as a result we will have unequality.
3. null can\`t be equal to string.
4. null\`s datatype is 'object'. So it can not be equal to 'number datatype'.

---

## Datatypes

1. //alert(`hello ${"name"}`)// Shows the string.
2. //alert(`hello ${name}`)// Shows the value of the variable.

---

## Logical operators

1. OR operator finds first truthy value. In our case it is 2.
2. OR operator finds that 1 is truthy but alert(1) can not be refered as true. So the first truthy value is 2.
3. AND operator finds the first falsy value. In our case it is null.
4. alert(1) and alert(2) are both falsy but as a result we we have alert(1) value and it is undefined.
5. The same methods we use here but we need to know that AND\`s percedence is higher than OR\`s.
